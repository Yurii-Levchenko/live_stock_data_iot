Project Concept: Real-Time Stock Monitoring and IoT Dashboard

Overview:
A Django-based application where:
    1. Users manage a list of favorite stock tickers and monitor real-time price updates via WebSocket.
    2. IoT devices simulate real-world devices pushing stock/market data via MQTT.
    3. The system supports CRUD operations for user preferences and IoT devices.
    4. The app provides a dashboard for historical data, API endpoints for external integrations, and real-time data streaming.

Detailed Plan
1. Core Features:

User Authentication:
    Use OAuth2/JWT for user login, API access, and securing WebSocket connections.
    Users can manage their profiles and set preferences (e.g., favorite stock tickers).

Real-Time Updates:
    Use WebSocket for broadcasting real-time updates to users on the dashboard.
    Simulate real-time data using MQTT, where devices send stock price updates.

IoT Device Management:
    CRUD operations for devices (e.g., “ticker-generating devices”).
    Each device can be associated with specific stocks it monitors.

Data Serialization and APIs:
    Use DRF to provide APIs for:
        Managing devices and user preferences.
        Accessing historical stock/device data.
    Support JSON and XML formats for exporting data.

Database:
    Store user details, device metadata, stock price history, and user preferences in PostgreSQL.
    Optimize queries using indexing for large-scale historical data.

Dashboard:
    Display real-time stock prices for user-selected tickers and device activity.
    Add a visualization (e.g., a Chart.js graph for stock trends).


2. Implementation Details:

User Authentication:
    Use django-oauth-toolkit for OAuth2 or djangorestframework-simplejwt for JWT.
    Secure the dashboard and APIs:
        Dashboard uses token-based authentication for WebSocket.
        RESTful API endpoints require authentication for CRUD operations.

Real-Time Updates (MQTT + WebSocket):
    MQTT:
        Simulate IoT devices using paho-mqtt to publish stock price updates.
        Devices send stock data (e.g., {"ticker": "AAPL", "price": 150.23}).
        Use a local MQTT broker like Eclipse Mosquitto for testing.
        Role of MQTT: Act as the transport layer for device data. Devices publish data to topics like stocks/AAPL, and your Django app subscribes to these topics to update the database or push updates to WebSocket.

    WebSocket:
        Use Django Channels for real-time updates.
        Broadcast stock price changes or device activity to the dashboard.
        Clients connect to WebSocket with their JWT token for authentication.

API with Django REST Framework:

    Build endpoints to:
        CRUD IoT devices.
        Get historical stock data (e.g., /api/stocks/<ticker>/history/).
        Manage user preferences (e.g., /api/users/preferences/).
        Expose data in both JSON and XML formats.

    Example data flow:
        Devices push stock prices to MQTT.
        Django subscribes to MQTT topics, updates PostgreSQL, and broadcasts updates via WebSocket.
        Historical data can be fetched through APIs.

Data Flow and Export:
    Data Sources:
        Simulate stock prices with a script generating random values or scraping data (e.g., Yahoo Finance using libraries like yfinance).

    Flow:
        IoT devices → MQTT → Django → WebSocket/API → User Dashboard.

    Exporting Data:
        Allow users to download historical stock data in JSON/XML from the dashboard or API.

Database (PostgreSQL):
    Schema:
        User: Stores user data.
        Stock: Stores stock metadata (name, ticker, sector, etc.).
        Device: Stores IoT device metadata.
        StockPrice: Tracks stock price history.
        UserPreferences: Links users to favorite tickers.
    Optimize StockPrice for large datasets using proper indexing.


3. Real-Time CRUD Operations:

    Devices:
        Add/update/delete device details via DRF APIs.
        Real-time changes:
            When a device is added, it starts publishing to MQTT. Updates notify connected users via WebSocket.
    Stock Updates:
        When a stock price changes (via MQTT), it updates the database and triggers WebSocket broadcasts.


4. Frontend Integration with React (Optional):

    Use React for the dashboard:
        Fetch data from DRF APIs for historical data.
        Use WebSocket for real-time updates.
        Visualize data with Chart.js or Recharts.
    Integrate React into your Django project using django-webpack-loader.


5. Custom Admin Features with Unfold:

    Install django-unfold for a polished admin interface.
    Create admin views for managing:
        Stock metadata.
        IoT devices and logs.
        User preferences.


6. Tools for Development and Testing:
    GitHub: Version control and project hosting.
    Postman: Test API endpoints.
    MQTT Tools:
        Install Eclipse Mosquitto for local MQTT.
        Use tools like MQTT Explorer to monitor topics.
    Django Debug Toolbar: Debug SQL queries and app performance.
    Testing Frameworks:
        Use Django’s built-in test tools for unit testing.
        Test WebSocket connections using pytest-django and pytest-channels.


7. Bonus Ideas:

    Add a notifications feature:
        Notify users of significant stock price changes via WebSocket or email.
    Deploy the app:
    Use Heroku or Railway with PostgreSQL.




Publish/Subscribe Workflow
    Simulated IoT Devices (simulate_devices.py):
        IoT devices simulate stock data by publishing messages to the MQTT broker on topics such as stocks/AAPL.
        These messages are sent to the broker at localhost:1883.

    MQTT Broker (Eclipse Mosquitto):
        Receives messages published by the IoT devices.
        Forwards these messages to all subscribers of the corresponding topic (stocks/#).

    Django MQTT Subscriber (iot/mqtt.py):
        Subscribes to stocks/# and listens for new messages.
        Upon receiving a message:
            Extracts the stock ticker and price.
            Updates the database (Stock and StockPrice models).
            Broadcasts the stock update to WebSocket clients via Django Channels.

WebSocket Consumer (dashboard/consumers.py):
    WebSocket clients (e.g., the dashboard) connect to ws://localhost:8000/ws/stocks/.
    When an update is received from the MQTT subscriber, the WebSocket broadcasts the update to all connected clients.
